## **Backend**

### Docker

Docker is required for this project to setup a local Postgres database. We use the database to store our song request. Please follow the following steps below to setup your local Docker container.

- First, create a docker container using the following command in the terminal.

    ``` docker
    docker run --name some-docker-name -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=some-secret-password -d postgres
    ```

- After we have created the Docker container, start the container if you haven't already.

- Once the container has been started, we should be able to connect to it using some sort of Postgres DB tool of your choice.

### Environment Variables

- After successfully setting up your local docker container, the next step is to setup your environment variables.

- Since in Go environment variables aren't based of a file rather they are based off of the operating systems own environment. Meaning we must set the environment variables in either our .bashrc or .zshrc.

- The list of the required environment variables can be found below.

    |  variable | value |
    |---|---|
    |  TWITCH_CLIENT_ID | Twitch Application CLIENT_ID   |
    |  TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET | Twitch Application CLEINT_SECRET  |  
    |  GOOGLE_API_KEY | Google Application API_KEY (most have YouTube API Enabled for the key to work) |
    | POSTGRES_CONN | postgresql://postgres-name:postgrespassword@localhost:port/table-name?sslmode=disable |
    | UNIT_TESTING_AUTH_CODE | ***(ONLY USE FOR UNIT TESTING! THIS IS NOT THE ACCESS_TOKEN, THIS IS THE CODE YOU USE TO AUTHENTICATE THE USER)*** twitch auth code  |

### Starting the Server

Once you have completed all the steps above, you can finally start the Fiber server. To do so Cd into the FinchBot-backend directory if you haven't already.

``` zsh
cd FinchBot-backend/
```

Then you can simply start the server by running the following command into the terminal.

```zsh
go run .
```

The terminal will then output the information of the server, meaning things are running correctly.

```zsh
 ┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
 │                   Fiber v2.34.0                   │
